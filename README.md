## serial_killers
# -Introduction-
In recent years, serial killers have grown in popularity in mainstream media. Documentaries on killers such as John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy are currently featured on Netflix. Hundreds of thousands of people tune in to watch the disturbing, yet fascinating stories of the men and the terrible crimes they commit. Some speculate that the interest in such horrific and terrible people comes from the inability to grasp what these offenders are even remotely capable. Serial killers have been present since before any of us were even around to learn anything about, let alone catch them. In the past 20 years the number of killers have dropped significantly due to advancements in science and technology but there was a time, before science caught up, that serial killers were running "rampant" and I will be expanding on that information and demonstrate the drop in serial kills. Overall the statistics point to serial killing being a male dominated past time but there is proof that it is not just men, but women as well though in much smaller numbers. 

I will be comparing numbers from the height of killing to today as well as the comparison of male serial killers to women serial killers. Noting the difference between both and the suspected reasons why one group is larger than the other.
